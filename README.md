I am PhD student at Kyushu Institute of technology and this project was completed under the guidance of Professor Hakaru Tamukoh  (https://www.brain.kyutech.ac.jp/~tamukoh/en/member_e/tamukoh/). 
Professor Hakaru Tamukoh (tamukoh@brain.kyutech.ac.jp) is Professor at Kyushu Institute of technology, Japan.
In this project I used transfer learning for gesture recognition. After Downloading Dockerand starting JupyterLab (as mentioned in GETTING STARTED WITH AI ON JETSON NANO course oofered by NVIDIA ) and connecting camera, I run the code ( gesture recognition using transfer learning) in Jupyterlab. Code was working well and was availbe to recognize gestures like: think, worry, excited, describe.
